# pointless-game

Using NodeJS, I created a pointless multiplayer game. This was to try out socket.io

Move a box with arrow keys and move a colored mouse other players can see.
The colored mouse only works with the first 4 players.

## Installation

You must have node and npm installed.

In the console, type `npm install`

## Run

To run, type `npm start`

Use Ctrl+C or Control+C to exit.
